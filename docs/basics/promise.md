## Promise
The Promise object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations. A Promise is in one of these states:

* pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
* fulfilled: successful operation
* rejected: failed operation.
* settled: the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.
